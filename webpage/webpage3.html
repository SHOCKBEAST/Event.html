        <p class="passion"> For swimming. I used to hate the waters, when I get into the water I feel disgusted.After attending to some lessons I manage to find that swimming is a fun sport.
            For learning the electronic organ, I was always the slowest and was most of the time scolded by my teacher. 
            There was once I wanted to quit organ but my mum persuaded me to stay and learn and so I did. I am so glad I did not quit and continued to play. Thus I am able to pick up playing organ as part of my hobby
